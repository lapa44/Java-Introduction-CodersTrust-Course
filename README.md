### General info
This project contains all the tasks from first part of Java Developer course led by Coders Trust.
See tasks list [here](#tasks).

* Java 11
* Maven
* JUnit 5
* Mockito
* Hamcrest

### Tasks
Each task has it's unit tests.
* <b>FooBar</b>
  * printing Foo or Bar, which depends from divisibility of for loop argument.
* <b>Multiplication Table</b>
  * prints 2-dimensional multiplication table with given size.
* <b>Christmas Tree</b>
  * prints christmas tree with given height.
* <b>Pascal Triangle</b>
  * prints a pascal triangle with given rows number.
* <b>Fibonacci numbers</b>
  * prints fibonacci numbers, using recursive or iterative method.
* <b>Sorting </b>
  * implemented several sorting algorithms. Abstract test class also checks time of sorting for all algorithms.
* <b>Sieve of Eratosthenes</b>
  * implemented algorithm which finds prime numbers.
* <b>Hanoi Towers</b>
  * implemented recursive algorithm which solves hanoi towers.
* <b>Numbers from file</b>
  * this task was used to practice IO operations, it sums each numbers text file row and saves it, e. g. 
      * Input: `1 2 3 4 5`
      * Output: `1+2+3+4+5=15`
* <b>Figures</b>
  * contains OOP - interface Figure, and it's implementations. This task learned me inheritance, because interface Figure contains method which calculates figure's area.
* <b>My own ArrayList</b>
  * my own implementation of interface List.
* <b>Regex</b>
  * simple task validating IpAddress v4 by using regex expression.
* <b>Streams</b>
  * honestly it's the same task as "Numbers from file", but this version was done using java streams.
* <b>Multithreading Magazine</b>
  * implemented 2 versions of multithreading magazine. One uses BlockingQueue, but the other one is synchronized manually.
  * <b>Binary Tree</b>
  * simple implementation of binary tree.

### Status
Currently done. When I finished course I decided I know basics of java and I need to focus on more advanced knowledge.
